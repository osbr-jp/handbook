# The OSBR Standard Repository

A template repository for creating standardized repositories over organization.

## Getting Started

1. Use this repository as a template for creating new repositories in osbr-jp organization.
2. Add branch rulesets (not copied from the standard repository).
    * `main` and `release` branch should be protected with the following rules:
        * Require pull request reviews before merging
        * Require status checks to pass before merging
3. Invite collaborators by authorizing teams.
4. Create a new GitHub Projects board by copying 'Standard Project Template'.
    * Configure a workflow option named 'Auto-add to project' to add issues to the project automatically.
5. Edit this README.md file to fit the new repository.

Below is a README that explains the settings configured in the template repository. Leave it as-is or modify if needed.

### Priority

Priority is used to determine the order of tasks to be worked on. Relatively set and updated by weekly planning.

| No | Priority      | Description                                                               |
|----|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | High          | High priority, must be done as soon as possible. |
| 2  | Medium-High   | High priority, but can be done after 'High' priority tasks. |
| 3  | Medium        | Medium priority, prioritized neither high nor low. |
| 4  | Medium-Low    | Low priority, but can be done before 'Low' priority tasks. |
| 5  | Low           | Low priority, can be done after 'Medium-Low' priority tasks. |

### Effort

Person days are used to estimate the number of days needed to complete a task. When this has 1 worker day, it means that it can be done in a day by a single person. Minimum person days are 0.25.

### Difficulty

Difficulty estimates the complexity of a task, which may arise from unclear specifications or insufficient information, as well as requiring advanced knowledge or expertise.

### Sprint

Sprint is a period of time during which specific work has to be completed and made ready for review. It is usually 1 week long.

## Weekly Planning

All developers participate in the weekly planning meeting to discuss the progress of the project and plan the next week's work.

Following is the agenda for the weekly planning meeting.

#### Update the project board

* Make sure all issues have correct `Labels`, `Priority`, `Effort`, and `Difficulty`.
* Check all issues in the previous sprint are closed and "Done" for status.
* Carry over issues that are not completed to the next current sprint.

#### Review the previous sprint's achievements and challenges

* Watch the demo movies of the completed pull requests at the previous sprint.
* Highlight completed tasks and their impact on the project.
* Identify any blockers or unresolved issues and discuss their root causes.
* Share lessons learned to improve future sprints.

#### Share individual progress updates

* Each team member provides a brief update on their tasks, progress, and any obstacles they are facing.
* Encourage questions and collaboration to address blockers or dependencies.

#### Align on priorities for the current sprint

* Confirm the scope of the sprint based on the carried-over issues and new priorities.
* Assign tasks to team members, ensuring alignment with their capacity and expertise.
* Discuss any adjustments to the project timeline if necessary.

#### Plan for the next steps

* Set deadlines for critical issues.
* Identify areas where team members may need additional support, such as training or resources.
* Schedule a follow-up session to review mid-sprint progress.

#### Close the meeting

* Summarize key takeaways and action items.
