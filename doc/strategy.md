## 1. Vision

#### In a world where businesses make people happy, regardless of its size, thrive more and more.
 
The limits to what a person can do may be small and limited, but everyone’s smartphone has the power to communicate with the world. Gradually, it has made opportunities more equal. Small things may turn to bigger opportunities. We believe it’s not a matter of who provides it, but rather, a good product will spread quickly and widely regardless.

## 2. Value Delivery Model

Our business domain is defined by the Value Delivery Model—a dynamic field where we innovate and deliver value by seamlessly integrating the physical and digital realms, as illustrated in the following diagram.

Since our founder established "beatfast" (later renamed "Saturday Inc.") in 2013, we have been working on conceptual internet services designed to develop software artifacts and gain business domain insights. These assets enable them to deliver semi-packaged solutions to their clients in Japan, not only providing OEM but also leveraging their knowledges to drive their businesses forward.

As OSBR, we expanded our visionary journey to "off-screen", as demonstrated by our projects [onray](https://www.weareonray.com/en) and [Time Crunch](https://www.wearetimecrunch.com/). These initiatives have provided invaluable feedback, inspiring us to envision even more innovative services while continuously refining our approach to deliver intuitive, impactful, and user-centered experiences that bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds. 

Leveraging this foundation—and without altering our core vision—we have shifted our mid-term focus toward enhancing digital experiences through the application of large language models (LLMs). From the "Experimental to Commercial Application" strategy we established as beatfast to the expansion into the physical domain as OSBR, we continue to evolve. By introducing innovative services powered by LLMs, we aim to empower our client businesses and accelerate their growth.

## 3. Business Model

Our Business Model is designed to sustain our visionary actions on the structure of the Value Delivery Model described above. We have three primary models: Client Work, Experimental Field Research, and Service Buyout. Each model is tailored to different stages of service development and delivery, providing flexibility and scalability to meet the diverse needs of our clients and partners.

### 3-1. Client Work

Our Client Work Model is designed to empower businesses by providing tailored solutions that integrate seamlessly into their original business. This model emphasizes close collaboration with clients to deliver innovative and efficient solutions that address their unique challenges.

Key elements of the Client Work Model include:

1. Customized Solutions: We identify client needs through rigorous analysis and consultation, ensuring our semi-packaged solutions are precisely aligned with their business goals.
2. Collaborative Development: Clients participate actively in the development process, from planning to launch, fostering a sense of ownership and ensuring the solution fits their context.
3. Scalability / Security: Our solutions are built to scale and secure, ensuring that they grow alongside the client’s business.
4. Continuous Support: Post-deployment, we provide ongoing support and updates to ensure long-term success and adaptability.

Through this model, we act not just as service providers but as partners in our clients’ growth, leveraging our expertise to transform challenges into opportunities.

### 3-2. Experimental Field Research

The Experimental Field Research Model focuses on fostering innovation by rapidly developing, testing, and iterating on new ideas in real-world contexts. This model is particularly suited for exploring emerging opportunities and validating concepts before scaling them into full-fledged services.

Key characteristics of the Experimental Service Model:

1. Proof of Concept (PoC): We create lightweight prototypes to test hypotheses and gather initial user feedback, minimizing risk and investment.
2. Agile Iteration: Leveraging user insights, we refine and evolve experimental services in short, iterative cycles.
3. Market Validation: Services are tested in targeted environments to assess feasibility, user adoption, and business potential.
4. Scalable Pathways: Successful experiments are positioned for scaling, either as standalone products or integrated into our broader offerings.

This model allows us to stay at the forefront of innovation while providing clients and collaborators with valuable insights and actionable prototypes to advance their goals.

### 3-3. Service Buyout

The Service Buyout Model is designed to transfer ownership of our services, users, contents, or intellectual property to clients or partners who wish to integrate them into their operations. This model ensures a seamless transition while maximizing the value delivered to the buyer.

Key aspects of the Service Buyout Model:

1. End-to-End Transition: We guide the client through the entire buyout process, including knowledge transfer, system integration, and operational handover.
2. Customizable Licensing: Buyers can choose from flexible licensing options tailored to their business needs, ensuring a smooth integration with their existing systems.
3. Scalable Frameworks: The services offered for buyout are built on robust and scalable architectures, enabling clients to expand and adapt as needed.
4. Post-Buyout Support: We offer optional post-buyout support services to assist with scaling, maintenance, and further customization.

This model not only enhances the client's ability to leverage our innovations but also provides us with the resources to reinvest in further development and new initiatives.
