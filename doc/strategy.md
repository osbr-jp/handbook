## 1. Vision

#### In a world where businesses make people happy, regardless of its size, thrive more and more.
 
The limits to what a person can do may be small and limited, but everyone’s smartphone has the power to communicate with the world. Gradually, it has made opportunities more equal. Small things may turn to bigger opportunities. We believe it’s not a matter of who provides it, but rather, a good product will spread quickly and widely regardless.

## 2. Field Overview

We began our visionary journey "off-screen", as demonstrated by our projects [onray](https://www.weareonray.com/en) and [Time Crunch](https://www.wearetimecrunch.com/). These initiatives have provided invaluable feedback, inspiring us to envision even more innovative services while continuously refining our approach to deliver intuitive, impactful, and user-centered experiences that bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds. 

Leveraging this foundation—and without altering our core vision—we have shifted our mid-term focus toward enhancing digital experiences through the application of large language models (LLMs). This isn't just for our in-house projects; we're also planning to work with outside partners to make even more exciting ideas to our life.
