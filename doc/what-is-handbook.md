# What is the OSBR Handbook?

The OSBR Handbook is a comprehensive guide to our culture, values, and workflows. It is designed to be a resource for our clients, team members, and future team members. Our commitment to transparency is reflected in the Handbook, which is intended to provide a clear understanding of who we are and how we work.
